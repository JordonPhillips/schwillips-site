        <div class="intro">
            <p>We're thrilled to celebrate our wedding with our closest friends and family on October 17th, 2026, at Mildenstein Castle. This page contains all the essential information you'll need for our special day.</p>

            <p>Please take time to read through the <a href="#location">location details</a>, <a href="#hotels">accommodation options</a>, <a href="#weather">weather expectations</a>, and <a href="#gifts">gift preferences</a> before submitting your <a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a>. If you have any questions, please reach out using the email address provided in your invitation.</p>
        </div>

        <section id="location">
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>The wedding will take place at <a href="https://www.burg-mildenstein.de/en/home/">Mildenstein Castle</a> in Leisnig, Germany. The castle has sat on a rocky outcrop above the Mulde River since at least 1046. It's now a museum with well-preserved medieval rooms including the Knight's Hall (where we'll be having the reception) and chapel.</p>

            <p>The castle has been carefully restored and is comfortable to visit while maintaining its historical character. The views of the surrounding countryside are gorgeous, and should be particularly beautiful in the fall. We'll be celebrating in spaces that have hosted gatherings for nearly a thousand years!</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Accessibility Note:</strong> The castle maintains its medieval character, which means there are stairs to reach both the ceremony and reception locations, plus an incline up to the main courtyard. A small freight elevator exists for supplies but cannot accommodate guests. Please let us know in your RSVP if you have mobility concerns.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You will, of course, be able to visit the museum sections of the castle. If you'd like to take part in a guided tour in English (or German), please let us know in your RSVP.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>The castle is about 2.5 hours from Berlin by car or 3 hours by train. From Leipzig, it's about 1 hour by either method. If arriving by train, note there's an uphill walk from Leisnig station to the castle (about 15 minutes), and taxis may not be readily available.</p>

        <section id="hotels">
            <h2>Accommodation</h2>

            <h3>In Leisnig</h3>
            <p>There are a few small guesthouses in town that are quite affordable, though not particularly fancy.</p>

            <p><strong>Gasthof Zum Stiefel</strong> is right outside the castle gates (‚Ç¨40-80/night). Since it only has five rooms, we'll likely book it out completely and prioritize it for guests with mobility issues. <strong>G√§stehaus am Markt</strong> is about a 10-minute walk (‚Ç¨80-90/night) and also only has a few rooms. Both have likely only have German-speaking staff, so let us know in your RSVP if you'd like to stay at either place and we can help with bookings.</p>

            <p>There are other options in town, but they're farther away and you'll likely need some German to book them. If you don't need to be right next to the castle, we'd recommend staying out of town where you'll have more options.</p>

            <h3>Out of Town</h3>
            <p><strong>"Die Karls Bande"</strong> is our top recommendation if you'll have a car. It's a modern hotel outside a strawberry-themed amusement park (you don't need park tickets to stay there, but it's worth a visit!). It's about 20 minutes from the castle, costs around ‚Ç¨120/night, and has English-speaking staff. We can arrange shuttles if there's enough interest.</p>

            <p><strong>D√∂beln</strong> is just one train stop away (12 minutes) and has several hotels for around ‚Ç¨100/night. You might find English-speaking staff there, though it's not guaranteed.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Note for D√∂beln guests:</strong> The last train back to D√∂beln leaves at 11pm, so you'll have some flexibility for the evening. We can also arrange shuttles to D√∂beln if there's interest. Please mention your transportation preferences in your RSVP.</p>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Leipzig</strong> is a major city about an hour away by train with lots of accommodation options starting around ‚Ç¨80/night. It's easy to find hotels with English-speaking staff there.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important for Leipzig guests:</strong> The last train back to Leipzig leaves at 9pm, which is quite early. If you're staying in Leipzig, you'll almost certainly need to arrange a car or pre-book a taxi. We might be able to arrange shuttles if there's significant interest. Please mention your transportation needs in your RSVP.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Berlin</h3>
            <p>We don't recommend staying in Berlin the night before or after unless you have a car - the train timing is too tight and there's too much risk of delays. That said, there will be some space at our home for immediate family in the days before and after the wedding.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>We can't predict the weather, but you should be prepared for it to be cold and/or rainy. The historical average temperature in Leisnig on October 17th is between 7¬∞-15¬∞ Celsfius or 44¬∞-59¬∞ Fahrenheit. Most of castle (including the ceremony and reception areas) has been renovated with underfloor heating and renewed insulation, so the interior should be comfortable no matter what.</p>


            <p>Note that you'll need to walk outside briefly to move between different areas of the castle, including between the ceremony and reception locations. We recommend bringing a jacket or coat that you can easily put on and take off, and an umbrella just in case.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gifts">
            <h2>Gifts</h2>
            <p>We know many of you are traveling far and spending a lot of money just to be with us on our special day. <strong>Your presence is truly the only present we need.</strong> Please don't feel any obligation to bring or send additional gifts. We genuinely mean this!</p>

            <p>That said, there is something we'd love that costs nothing but would mean a lot to us: <strong>your favorite recipes</strong>. We both enjoy cooking and baking, and we'd be love to create our own cookbook filled with recipes from the people we love most.</p>

            <p>Every time we make one of your dishes, we'll think of you and the memories we share. It's a gift that keeps giving, much better than anything we could put on a registry. If we can, we'll bind them together into a physical cookbook and also create a digital version to share with everyone who is interested.</p>

            <p>Please include the stories behind your recipes! Are they family traditions? Connected to special memories or people? Perfect for certain seasons or occasions? We want to know it all, as the context makes each recipe even more meaningful.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that the groom is vegetarian, so recipes where meat isn't the main focus work best (though we can adapt in most cases).</p>

            <p>If you really feel compelled to bring something physical despite our protests, let us know and we can suggest a few specific items. (Like things that aren't easily available in Germany.) But honestly, the recipes will mean so much to us.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="rsvp">
            <h2>RSVP</h2>
            <p>While the castle is beautiful, the medieval rooms have limited capacity, so we need to plan carefully for everyone's comfort. <strong>Please RSVP regardless of whether you're coming, not coming, or unsure</strong> - we need to hear from everyone! If you have a plus-one on your invitation but don't think you'll use it, please let us know as it might allow us to invite someone else. We can only accommodate the guests specified on your invitation due to space constraints.</p>

            <p><strong>Please RSVP as soon as possible</strong> so we can send out additional invitations if space permits. We need at least a "maybe" response by <strong>December 31st, 2025</strong> at the latest.</p>

            <p>To RSVP, please send us an email at the address that was in your invitation. (If we put it up on this site we'd get spammed.)</p>

            <p><strong>Everyone please include:</strong></p>
            <div class="rsvp-list">
                <ul>

                    <li>How many people will be attending with you?</li>
                    <li>Would you be interested in a digital copy of the wedding cookbook?</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Where will you likely be staying?</li>
                    <li>Will you be renting a car? If so, would you be willing to drive other people to/from the castle?</li>

        <section id="pre-wedding">
            <h2>Pre-Wedding Business</h2>
            <p>Two days before the celebration at the castle, we'll have a civil ceremony at the Standesamt (civil registry office) in Berlin. In Germany, this legal ceremony is required to become officially married and is distinct from the celebration that we'll do at the castle. The civil ceremony is quite short and formal, conducted by a government official with just a few witnesses present. It's usually only immediate family, and it must be done in Berlin since that's where we're registered residents.</p>

            <p>Think of it as getting our marriage license, but with a bit more ceremony than you'd have in the US. It's an interesting part of German wedding tradition where the legal and celebratory aspects are typically separated.</p>

            <p>If you're part of the immediate family or wedding party, you're also invited to join us for this pre-wedding civil ceremony. If you need a place to stay in Berlin, you're welcome to stay with us as long as you're fine sleeping on a couch, sofa bed, or air mattress.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="visiting">
            <h2>Visiting Germany</h2>

            <h3>Before You Arrive</h3>
            <p>You may be required to get an <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/etias">ETIAS travel authorization</a> to come from abroad, even as an American. You'll need to do this ahead of time, so check early to see what the requirements are. It's expected to begin in Q4 of 2026, so right in time for the wedding.</p>

            <h3>Money & Payments</h3>
            <p>Germany uses the Euro. When you get here, make sure to get some cash - lots of places don't take cards at all, especially smaller restaurants, bakeries, and some shops. Many places that do take cards prefer EC cards (German debit cards) over credit cards. ATMs are widely available, but your bank may charge fees.</p>

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Many Germans speak English - they start learning it in third grade. Younger people generally speak it better. You don't need to know German to get by, but learning a few basic phrases is appreciated and polite. "Danke" (thank you), "Bitte" (please/you're welcome), and "Entschuldigung" (excuse me) go a long way.</p>

            <p>Note that the wedding location is part of what was formerly East Germany, where people were more likely to learn Russian as a second language. People there still are less likely to know English, especially the older people. Berlin, being more international, has many more native English speakers and generally better English overall.</p>

            <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
            <p>Public transit in Germany is excellent. Download the Deutsche Bahn app for long-distance trains. If you'll be here for a while, consider buying a "Deutschland Ticket" (then immediately cancel the subscription) - it covers everything except high-speed trains (IC and ICE). In Berlin, use the BVG app for local transit.</p>

            <p>Important train tips: Long-distance train tickets don't include seat reservations - pay extra to guarantee a seat. There are no ticket gates, but you must have a valid ticket. Inspectors perform random checks, and fines can be up to several hundred euros. You can eat and drink on long-distance trains, but not on local trains, trams, or buses. Keep noise levels down.</p>

            <h3>Food & Dining</h3>
            <p>While you're here, definitely try D√∂ner - it's delicious German-Turkish street food (though very meat-heavy). As far as Leisnig goes, there's a good tavern right outside the castle with traditional German cuisine. German bakeries tend to have a very high floor when it comes to quality, and there are several in Leisnig near the castle. We can also recommend places in Berlin based on your preferences, but don't expect great Mexican food.</p>

            <p>Tipping is typically 5-10% at sit-down places and you usually round up or tell the server the total you want to pay after they've given you the pre-tip total. If paying by card, they'll bring a card reader to you rather than taking your card away. But make sure you have cash for restaurants as they might not take card!</p>

            <h3>Cultural Notes</h3>
            <p>Germans are quite socially-minded. It's important to follow the rules and to not bother others. In particular, keep your volume low in public, especially on public transit.</p>

            <p>Shops are generally closed on Sundays except for restaurants, some tourist areas like museums, and train stations. Quiet hours ("Ruhezeit") are typically 10pm-6am and Sunday afternoons - be extra careful to keep noise down during these times.</p>

            <h3>Extending Your Trip</h3>
            <p>If you're traveling far for the wedding, consider staying longer to explore (and justify the plane ticket)!</p>

            <p>The wedding is in October, and it's in Germany, so you might be interested in attending Oktoberfest. Despite the name, it actually starts in September and ends in early October. In 2026 it's expected to run from September 19th through October 4th, so if you want to attend you'll need to arrive quite a bit before the wedding. The main event is in Munich, and while you will find smaller festivities elsewhere, it really is mostly a Munich thing.</p>

            <p>For Munich Oktoberfest: You'll definitely need reservations at beer tents, especially on weekends. Book through the official Oktoberfest website or individual tent websites starting in late spring. Without reservations, you can sometimes get in on weekday mornings, but it's risky. Expect to pay premiums for beer and food, double what you might pay elsewhere or at different times. It's crowded, loud, and touristy, but might be fun if that's your thing.</p>

            <p>If you're more interested in October festivals closer to the wedding location, Saxony has several wine and harvest festivals throughout October. Dresden (about 1.5 hours from Leisnig) often has autumn markets and cultural events. The region also celebrates various local harvest festivals that are much more authentic and less touristy than Munich's Oktoberfest. Karls Erlebnisdorf, the amusement park whose hotel I recommended, also will have some fall theming around that time.</p>
