            <p>We're thrilled to celebrate our wedding with our closest friends and family on October 17th, 2025, at Mildenstein Castle. This page contains all the essential information you'll need for our special day.</p>

            <p>Please take time to read through the <a href="#location">location details</a>, <a href="#hotels">accommodation options</a>, <a href="#weather">weather expectations</a>, and <a href="#gifts">gift preferences</a> before submitting your <a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a>. If you have any questions, please reach out using the email address provided in your invitation.</p>
        </div>

        <section id="location">
            <h2>Location</h2>
            <p>The wedding will take place at <a href="https://www.burg-mildenstein.de/en/home/">Mildenstein Castle</a> in Leisnig, Germany. The castle has sat on a rocky outcrop above the Mulde River since at least 1046. It's now a museum with well-preserved medieval rooms including the Knight's Hall (where we'll be having the reception) and chapel.</p>
            
            <p>The castle has been carefully restored and is comfortable to visit while maintaining its historical character. The views of the surrounding countryside are gorgeous, and should be particularly beautiful in the fall. We'll be celebrating in spaces that have hosted gatherings for nearly a thousand years!</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Accessibility Note:</strong> The castle maintains its medieval character, which means there are stairs to reach both the ceremony and reception locations, plus an incline up to the main courtyard. A small freight elevator exists for supplies but cannot accommodate guests. Please let us know in your RSVP if you have mobility concerns.</p>
            </div>

            <p>You will, of course, be able to visit the museum sections of the castle. If you'd like to take part in a guided tour in English (or German), please let us know in your RSVP.</p>

            <h3>Getting There</h3>
            <p>The castle is about 2.5 hours from Berlin by car or 3 hours by train. From Leipzig, it's about 1 hour by either method. If arriving by train, note there's an uphill walk from Leisnig station to the castle (about 15 minutes), and taxis may not be readily available.</p>

        <section id="hotels">
            <h2>Accommodation</h2>

            <h3>In Leisnig</h3>
            <p>There are a few small guesthouses in town that are quite affordable, though not particularly fancy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Gasthof Zum Stiefel</strong> is right outside the castle gates (‚Ç¨40-80/night). Since it only has five rooms, we'll likely book it out completely and prioritize it for guests with mobility issues. <strong>G√§stehaus am Markt</strong> is about a 10-minute walk (‚Ç¨80-90/night) and also only has a few rooms. Both have likely only have German-speaking staff, so let us know in your RSVP if you'd like to stay at either place and we can help with bookings.</p>
            
            <p>There are other options in town, but they're farther away and you'll likely need some German to book them. If you don't need to be right next to the castle, we'd recommend staying out of town where you'll have more options.</p>

            <h3>Out of Town</h3>
            <p><strong>"Die Karls Bande"</strong> is our top recommendation if you'll have a car. It's a modern hotel outside a strawberry-themed amusement park (you don't need park tickets to stay there, but it's worth a visit!). It's about 20 minutes from the castle, costs around ‚Ç¨120/night, and has English-speaking staff. We can arrange shuttles if there's enough interest.</p>
            
            <p><strong>D√∂beln</strong> is just one train stop away (12 minutes) and has several hotels for around ‚Ç¨100/night. You might find English-speaking staff there, though it's not guaranteed.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Note for D√∂beln guests:</strong> The last train back to D√∂beln leaves at 11pm, so you'll have some flexibility for the evening. We can also arrange shuttles to D√∂beln if there's interest. Please mention your transportation preferences in your RSVP.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Leipzig</strong> is a major city about an hour away by train with lots of accommodation options starting around ‚Ç¨80/night. It's easy to find hotels with English-speaking staff there.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important for Leipzig guests:</strong> The last train back to Leipzig leaves at 9pm, which is quite early. If you're staying in Leipzig, you'll almost certainly need to arrange a car or pre-book a taxi. We might be able to arrange shuttles if there's significant interest. Please mention your transportation needs in your RSVP.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Berlin</h3>
            <p>We don't recommend staying in Berlin the night before or after unless you have a car - the train timing is too tight and there's too much risk of delays. That said, there will be some space at our home for immediate family in the days before and after the wedding.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="weather">
            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>We can't predict the weather, but you should be prepared for it to be cold and/or rainy. The historical average temperature in Leisnig on October 17th is between 7¬∞-15¬∞ Celsfius or 44¬∞-59¬∞ Fahrenheit. Most of castle (including the ceremony and reception areas) has been renovated with underfloor heating and renewed insulation, so the interior should be comfortable no matter what.</p>
            

            <p>Note that you'll need to walk outside briefly to move between different areas of the castle, including between the ceremony and reception locations. We recommend bringing a jacket or coat that you can easily put on and take off, and an umbrella just in case.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gifts">
            <h2>Gifts</h2>
            <p>For those of you coming from far away, we know that the cost simply to get here will be high. So naturally we don't expect you to be spending a bunch of money on wedding gifts. There is, however, something we would like that will cost you nothing: <strong>recipes</strong>.</p>

            <p>We both love cooking and baking, and we'd love to have some recipes that we can make and remember you by. We would be delighted if you would write out some of your favorite recipes for us, which we can then bind together to make a cookbook. If we can physically bind them together we will, but in any event we're planning to digitize them and make them available to all our guests.</p>

            <p>We'd also love it if you include as much context as possible for the recipes. Are they connected to any strong memories, or important people? Are they for a particular time, event, or season? Do you have any great memories associated with them? We would love to know, and love to keep it.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind that the groom is vegetarian, so perhaps avoid recipes where meat is the star of the show. If it's just some small bit, we can always do substitutions.</p>

            <p>If you nevertheless want to bring something physical, let us know and we can get you some ideas. There are some US specific baking dishes that can't be bought in Germany for example.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="rsvp">
            <h2>RSVP</h2>
            <p>To RSVP, please send us an email at the address that was in your invitation. (If we put it up on this site we'd get spammed.) Make sure to include all of the following information:</p>

            <div class="rsvp-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Do you have mobility issues, or otherwise a need to stay very close by?</li>
                    <li>Where will you likely be staying?</li>
                    <li>Will you be renting a car? If so, would you be willing to drive other people to/from the castle?</li>
                    <li>Would you be interested in a guided tour of the castle?</li>
                    <li>Would you be interested in a digital copy of the wedding cookbook?</li>
                    <li>Do you have any dietary restrictions?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>



        <section>
            <h2>Pre-Wedding Business</h2>
            <p>If you're part of the immediate family or wedding party, you're welcome to stay with us in Berlin as long as you're cool sleeping on a couch, sofa bed, or blow up mattress. There is a very small ceremony that will take place two days before the wedding in which we'll get what is effectively our wedding license. This is somewhere between a bureaucratic endeavor and ceremony that is part of German wedding tradition. It is much smaller than the wedding ceremony, usually only immediate family. This will be in Berlin because it must be done in the place where we actually live.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Non-Wedding Stuff</h2>
            <p>You may be required to get an ETIAS visa to come from abroad, even as an American. You'll need to do this ahead of time, so check early to see what the requirements are. It's expected to begin in Q4 of 2026, so right in time for the wedding.</p>

            <p>When you get here, make sure to get some cash. Lots of places don't take cards at all, so you will need cash.</p>

            <p>If you're coming from out of town, you might want to stay in Germany a while to justify the cost of travel. Here's some things to keep in mind.</p>

            <p>Public transit in this country is generally excellent. I would recommend downloading the Deutsche Bahn app for long distance transit. If you'll be here for some time it might make sense to buy a "Deutschland Ticket" and then immediately cancel the subscription. That'll get you everything except the high speed, long distance trains (IC and ICE). In Berlin you'll want to download the BVG tickets app. Other cities and areas will have their own systems, which you may be able to pay for through the Deutsche Bahn app. Of course you can also find ticket kiosks at the main train stations if you'd rather get a physical ticket.</p>

            <p>If you're booking a long-distance train (IC / ICE), note that a seat is not included with the ticket. You must pay a bit extra to book a seat. You might still get a seat without booking one, but it'll depend on what's free, and you'll have to get up if somebody has a reservation. Medium-distance trains (RC / RE) have no seat reservations, so it's just luck. First class is of course more sparse, but not all trains will have it and it's expensive.</p>

            <p>You can eat and drink on medium and long distance trains, but not on short-distance trains, trams, subways, or busses. Also please do not be loud.</p>

            <p>There are no ticket gates, but you still need a ticket. People may come around to check your ticket, and if you don't have one you'll get a fine of several hundred euros that you'll have to pay immediately or go to jail. Don't risk it.</p>

            <p>Oktoberfest takes place at the end of September/ early October. So if you want to take part in that, you'll need to arrive quite a bit earlier. The main event is in Munich, though there will be celebrations to a lesser extent through the rest of the country. You may need to make early reservations for some places, especially in Munich.</p>

            <p>Lots of people in Germany speak English. They start learning it when they're in third grade. That said, younger people generally will be better at it. You don't need to know German to get by, but it can help and it's polite.</p>

            <p>If you want to go to other countries, check their entry requirements. You may need a separate visa. Also check what currency they use as not everybody uses the euro. Poland, for example, uses their own currency. Consider using sleeper trains to travel between countries. They're way less hassle than flying, if slower. And better for the environment.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>While you're here, make sure to try some D√∂ner. It's a German/Turkish street food that's quite tasty. It is very meat heavy though. Being almost all meat.</p>

            <p>There's a tavern outside the castle that's quite good and has some traditional German cuisine.</p>

            <p>We can recommend some places in Berlin depending on what you like, but don't expect to find any Mexican food that's better than mediocre.</p>
